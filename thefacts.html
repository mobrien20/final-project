    <h3>Statistics/Facts</h3>
    <ul><br>
      <li>Black Rhinos, which reside in the African savannas,  have been dying in an alarming rate since 1995. The Rhinos are being illegally hunted by poachers for their tusks. In return, the tusks can be used as ivory in jewelry, billiard balls, pianos, etc. All of these deaths are for human entertainment.   Black Rhino population- Before: 70,000 (1970)   After: 5,000-5,400 (2018) </<li>
        <br><br>
      <li>The Sumatran Elephant, found on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, is considered to be critically endangered. In one generation, the elephants lost half of their population mainly due to deforestation and the excessive poachers. Poachers kill and remove their tusks to make ivory, which is used in jewelry and primarily human enjoyment.    Sumatran Elephant population- Before: 2,800-4,800 (1985)  After:2,400 2,800</li>
        <br>
      <li>Chimpanzees, native to the continent of Africa, are labeled as endangered. Primary threats to the species are habitat destruction, hunting and disease. The hunting of chimpanzees as a source of meat is not new to African countries, but bushmeat is becoming very popular in the market, hence the decreasing population. Also, the increasing tourists and human interactions with the chimpanzees expose harmful diseases to them. Chimpanzees population- Before:     2,000,000 (1900) After: 150,000-250,000 (2017)</li>
        <br>
      <li>Hawksbill Turtles, found throughout the tropical oceans around the world, are critically endangered.  Their vibrant colored shells make them very targeted by the market, hence the reason why they are decreasing so drastically. They are commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" which can be used for jewelry and ornaments, and the shells are dominate in eastern Asia's markets. Another way they commonly die is because they are prone to getting entangled in gillnets and fishing hooks, drowning to their deaths from the lack of oxygen. Also, climate change effects the turtles because it causes the ocean temperatures to be warmer, making the turtles move to new locations, making it harder for them to find food.    Hawksbill Turtles population- Before: 79,300 (1920)   After:  20,000-23,000 (2018)</li>
      <br>
      <li> Māui Dolphins, the world's rarest marine dolphin, is the subspecies of the Hector's dolphin. Found off the west coast of North Island in New Zealand, the species is dying off due to a rapid increase in temperature of the oceans. With prey diminishing, competition for food is highly competitive. Not only is climate change effecting the dolphins, but human-caused deaths plays a big part in the decreasing population. Māui Dolphins population- Before: 1000 (1970) After: 63 (2018) </li>
      <br>
      <li> Polar Bears, residing in the Arctic, are currently labeled as vulnerable. The loss of ice glaciers and ice sheets, due to climate change, are damaging the Polar Bear population because there is not as many ice sheets for the bears to stay on while looking for their prey. Also, sea levels are heightening at an alarming rate, making it harder for them to find seals or fish. Essentially, Polar Bears are starving to their deaths as a result of climate change. Polar Bear population- Before: 25,000 (1981)  After: 17,000 (2014) </li>
      <br>
      <li> West Indian Manatees, found as close as Florida, and also found throughout the Caribbean, southeastern United States, eastern Mexico, Central America, etc., are known to be vulnerable. Manatees, also known as "sea cows", are currently vulnerable because they are being affected by collisions with boats and loss of warm water springs. They also get entangled with fishing gear and the loss of seagrass due to pollutants makes it harder for them to find food. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Manatees are not legally permitted to be hunted, but they are still not safe from the dangers and climate change.  West Indian Manatee population- Before: 13,000 (1990)  After: 6,000 (2018) </li>
      <br>
      <li> Hawaiian Monk Seals live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Being one of the most endangered species in the world, the Monk Seals are lessening as a result of disease, human interaction and being attacked as prey. Although there are multiple factors, one of the most important factors that are taking into consideration is the rising sea levels and habitat loss. The loss of Hawaiian land prevents the turtles from being able to lay the eggs safely on land. Rising sea levels threatens the pupping habitat - all an effect of climate change. Hawaiian Monk Seals population - Before: 3,000 (1957)   After: 1,400 (2017) (edited) </li>
      <br>
      <li> Grevy's Zebras, living in the continent of Africa, are endangered since they are constantly targeted by hunters. Also, the Zebras are losing more and more land everyday, forcing the species to constantly roam around to new areas they may be unfamiliar with,  leading them to work harder for their food and water. Zebras also live in herds, so having to move locations can be difficult for them to adjust. Grevy's Zebra population- Before: 15,000 (1970 After: 2,812 (2018) </li>
